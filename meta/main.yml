  # With the release of version 2.10, Ansible finally correctly
  # identifies Kali Linux as being the Kali distribution of the Debian
  # OS family.  This simplifies a lot of things for roles that support
  # Kali Linux, so it makes sense to force the installation of Ansible
  # 2.10 or newer.
  min_ansible_version: 2.10

  platforms:
    # cyhy-core is still Python 2 and with distributions ending support for
    # Python 2 we can only support a limited number of platforms.
